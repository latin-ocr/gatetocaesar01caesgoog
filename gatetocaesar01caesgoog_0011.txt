Caesar is a difficult author. Some parts of his Gallio War
¹ are as hard, or nearly as hard, as any prose Latin that has
come down to us. Yet it has somehow strangely enough
become the fashion to read that work first in a Latin course.
My own conviction is that for young learners a year's read-
ing in easier Latin is not too much before taking up the·
less diffioult books of the Gallio War. Even then the
transition to Caesar comes with something of a shock3 for
the learner is soon and often brought face to face with
sentences that seem to him oi most bew'ildering intricacy,
however they may, as commentators sometimes remark,
beautifully illustrate most important principles of Latin
order and construction. There isa sentence in the second
book, by no means the most difficult one to be found, that
extends through eighteen lines-that is, something more
than half a paga-containing twenty-one distinct ideas,
and having the verb separated from its subject by ninety·
four words.

I know no more disheartening task than that of under-
taking to carry a class unprepared in age and knowledge
of the language through Caesar's Gallio War. Yet it is prc-

ciscly this disheartening task that thousands of teachers are ·

set to do, or set themselves to do, every year. The results
are often dismal enough. Teachers are blamed, they blame
themselves, they blame their pupils. Pupils may sometimes
be stupid, teachers may lack knowledge of the language
and the subject, but the fault may also lie wholly with the
author or with the Latin language itself ; if with the latter,
there is no help. Latin, it must be confessed, isan exceed-
ingly difficult language to learn. All the more reason then
why, in attacking it, every unnecessary obstacle should be
removed. We should make our approaohes with cantion
