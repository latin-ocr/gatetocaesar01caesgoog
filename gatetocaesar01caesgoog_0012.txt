and skill; we should take it, if possible, aperto latere. We
should not begin with a difficult work· or if, in the dearth
of Latin suited to the juvenile mind, thiais deemed unavoid-
able, common sense suggests the query, why aot remove

Caesar knew how to write his own language well; hut he
wrote for men, he wrote with compression and m haste, and
there are passages in his works that are tough reading for a
good Latin scholar. It rs the fashion to praise Caesar's lu·

“Ther nys no werkman, what so ever he be,
That may botho werke wel, and hastily.

² For my part 1 confess that I sometimes find him obscure.
Moreover‚ when I am in doubt as to his meaning and appeal
to the commentatore, I find that they generally disagree and
sometimes quarrel about the sense. Therefore to put young
learners to reading Caesar as his text stands, bristling with
difficulties, before they have acquired anything more thane
meagre voeabulary and gained a modicum of insight hy some
practice in reading easier Latin, is to set them at a task
harder than that whioh Pharaoh set the Israelites.

I am of the opinion that, even when a fair working voeabu-
lary has been acquired through some previous reading, there
is no book of the Gallio War that does not require a oertain
degree of simplification to bring it to the level of the powers
oi young boys and girls, It is this eonviotion born of long
observation of the vexation of spirit, discouragement, and
waste of time by pupils in wrestling with difficulties that
