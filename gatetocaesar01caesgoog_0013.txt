inevitably floor them, that has prompted me to put my
hand to this work, which, slight as it may seem, has eost me
the leisure of many months. But I shall feel repaid ten-
fold, ii, through this little book, boys and girls are enabled
to read Oaesar with less waste of time, mo're easily, with

fresher interest, and added sense oi power; if, in other
words, it proves in reality what it is in name, a (iate to
Gaesar. ⁸

A few words will be sufficient to explain the principle on
which I have simplified Oaesar's text, the amount of excision,
and the degree of change. It would have been a compara
tively easy task to simplify the text by the mere process
of omission, never deviating from the ipsissimo cerba of the
author by so much as the change ol a mode or tense. One
could do this and still string together the disjecto membro
oi the text into something like a connected narrative. But
. that would be to preserve the integrity ol the words attho
expense of everything else, - inner relation, structure, style,
spirit. Or the simplification might be effected by a virtual
rewriting oi the text, by amplification rather than suppresa
sion, coupled with changes in the collocatiou ‚of words,
where the arrangement seemed to obscure the meaning and
perplex the learner.

My purpose and plan differed essentially from both these
methods. My aim has been, first, to keep the narrative in-
tact; second, to retain as much of the text as was consistent
with the effert to disburden it oi its greater difficulties3
third, to make the fewest practicable changes in what was
retained, save the modification oi some verb forms, and
the occasional rendering of indireot into direct discourse;
fourth, very rarely to change the position of a word;
finally, never to insert a word, except now and then
