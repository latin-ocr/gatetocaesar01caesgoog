NOTE ΟΝ THE Usn OF THE BOOK.

The Simplified Text and the Exercises based upon it are oi the
first importance. 'Phe cive occe translation ol the Exercises‚ followed
by the writing of them, will illustrate and help ιο implent in the
memory the most important principles of syntax met with in the text.
Let the teaoher insist upon thorough work here, and he may saiely

. omit other syntectical instruction.

But little power ol reading Latin can be gained without making
the acquisition oi aworking vocabulary a distinct object. The Latin '
synonyme and the Etymological Vocabulary may be made useiul
agents ιο that end. If the words added ιο each chapter are read
aloud, reviewed, and compared where backward references are made,
the learner will acquire a uselul stoch oi synonyme easily, naturally,
and with small expenditure oi time.

It is often eaeier ιο retain in mind a number of words, grouped
according to some principle oi similarity or contrast, than a single
word with nothing to hook it to the memory. For this reason itis
recommended that the Etymological Vocabulary be olten pressed into
the service. Suppose, ior example, the word conspectus occurs in the
lesson. ii the teacher will turn to page 138 and have the ten words
read out under the root SPEC, he will multiply several times the
chauces that this particular word will be remcmbered on its next
occurrence. He will have done muoh more. He will have increased
the chauces that nine other words will be lodged in the memory; and
ιο each one a fresh interest will be added by its being seen in relation,
not as an isolated‚ and therefore barren, fact.

The first vocabulary may be used for comparing in the text the
different meanings aud uses of the same word. lt is through such
comparisons that one gets at the heart and spirit of the lenguage,
w'hile cultivating at the same time a mental habit oi great velue.

Having read the Simplified Text, the learner should be well equipped

for wrestling with the difficulties that remain in the unchanged text,
ior he is already familiar with the thought and the language. Com-
parison oi the two texts by the teacher, so iar as time permits, may
now be made ιο illustrate important principles, as oi indireet discourse,
which are here and there discussed in the notes.
