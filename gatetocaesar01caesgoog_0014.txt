to supply a form plainly understood, or to introduce some η
connective, like et, tum, itaque, cutem, cryc, postremo.

As to the amount of excision, 1 find that 1 have omitted
almost exaotly oue-fifth of ansar's text.

If the beginner in Caesar reads the simplified text and
concurrently turns the Exercises into Latin, laying firm
hold of the grammatical principles selected for illustration,
1 believe he will find the remaining difficulties of the origi·
nal text not beyond his scope. I should even hope that
, he would then read with something of the joy of conscious
power. If the reading of the texts and the writing of the
Exercises should require more time than is usually spent
on the second book of Caesar, which, however,‘I doubt, 1
believe subsequent progress would still be rapid and satis-
factory enough to amount toa net gain and saving of time. ¹

It has seemed best to mark long vowels, except the
vowels of final syllables and of monosyllableS, the rules for
which can be readily learned. I have, however, marked a

· few monosyllables‚ as accustant reminder to teachers who

find their old pronunciatiou clinging to certain words We
used to say bis, sic, adn, quin, lide. These words, therefore,

. f Ihave marked. On the other hand, one is in nc danger of

saying dc, bi, si, prd, for old habit would not mislead.

Ι take pleasure in acknowledging my obligations to Mr.
- Alfred G. Rolfe for several useful criticisms‚ and to Miss
Caroline Ober Stone for valuable corrections and for care-
fully reading the proof-sheets as far as the vocabularies.
Tc Mr. Clarence W. Gleason I am specially indebted. But
for his timely and generous aid in preparing both vocabu-
laries, the publication of this book must have been very

considerably delayed.
