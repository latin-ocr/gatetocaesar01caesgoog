Tnn recent discovery of a work of Aristotle has inter-
ested and delighted the whole learned world; but one may
venture to say that if, instead, a bools had been found
written in the best period of the Latin language for the
amusement or instruction of youth, by some Roman De
Foe, or Goldsmith, or Lamb, or Burnett, there would be ten
times the reason for rejoioing. Unhappily there is no

likelihood that we shall ever congratulate ourselves on
suoh a “find'’ for probably no suoh work ever existed.
What a misfortune that it did not ooour to Cicero to divort
himself in some leisure hour by writing a story for Roman
youth! Millions of boys and girls in these later ages would
have had good reason to bless his name. Oaesar eould have
done it; but to him, too, the gods denied suoh an inspiration,
and we must suffer for it. Seeing that he had oomposed a
treatise on Latin Grammar, one almost wonders that a mind
so original and fertile should not have oonoeived the idea
of adapting his Gallio War, or some part of it, to the
‘powers and eomprelrension of youth. What measureless
gratitudo would he not bave won from unborn generations
of sohoolmasters, who have now to struggle desperately and
often unavailingly to make olear to their pupils the meaning
ol his intrioate periods, and untwist the strands of his
knotty syntaxi
