Iuraonncroar Nora-To translate Latin luto English is to express
the meaningof the Latin in Englishwords end in theEnglish idiom. Butthe
meaning must he discovered before it can be expressed. Discoveriug the
sense is, therefore, aprocess preparatory to translation, but yet measurably
distinct from it. For discovering the meaning, the golden rule is, Talae
words ond clauses tn tlte order iu which they stand. Ii the first chapter
, ot this book were rendered into English words exaotly in the Latin order,
the thought would be readily apprehended by any one quite nuacquainted

with Latin. Such a word ior word rendering, mental or orel, is lor the
ἓ beginner a necessary prelimiuary to translation, but, 1 repeat, must not be
ι coniounded with translation For that, the golden rule is, Expecto tlte
ξ thought ia porc English, without odmiaeture os Latin idiom.
